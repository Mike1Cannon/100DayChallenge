# 100DayChallenge
This is a Day by Day tracking sheet for a 100 Day Coding Challenge. It's also meant to help beginners (like me :p) learn the ropes of using GitHub. I'm still learning as well, so feel free to drop some suggestions or changes you think would help.

Instructions:
1. Add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md
2. Add your progress to the DayByDay.md - It doesn't matter what day you start on. You can add the date at the beginning of your entry.
  See Example Below:
